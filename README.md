**-How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

  In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adatable you should write your code with practices like modularized functions, proper/appropiate functionn names and variables. Further more, using an object-oriented approach with inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphic behavior for code readability and reduction are also valuable during development that aid in testable code where errors are more apparant to fix. These proper practices will not only aid in your own work flow but better its comprehensibility for a situation where you are in a team. 

**-How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

  It's important to take into consideration the clients needs when choosing the correct database platform. The client may have certain requirements that you need to work with. MongoDb provides aggregation pipeline functionality to create filtered queries and info in the components of the Model-View-Controller functionality. We used DASH with Python for the view, Python with Pymongo for the controller, and Mongodb for the model database. It is one thing with a programs functionality but communication with a client will provide the demographic that is sought out and the overall structure that needs to be followed by the develpoment team.

**-What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

  Computers themselves are tools that serve a humans problems through the actions of what the human is telling it to do. The human that has the appopriate knowledge to do so in a manner where it may "engineer" the machine to solve a specific something. This is where computer scientists step in and fill that role as the "engineer" for this machine. Developing this application for Grazioso Salvare, while also taking into account security, optimization and query speed, size of the database, we can create quick queries that meet the company's needs. Providing the company with way to aggregate thier own databases which can help achieve business goals in a more timely/smooth.
